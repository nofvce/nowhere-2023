00:00:14.916 --> 00:00:16.666
<i>It has now been seven months</i>

2
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:19.041
<i>since Spain
began applying European measures</i>

3
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.708
<i>to tackle the shortage of basic resources.</i>

4
00:00:21.791 --> 00:00:24.416
<i>The plan, called ''Not Enough for All,"</i>

5
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.083
<i>has started to produce results.</i>

6
00:00:26.166 --> 00:00:29.125
<i>But for now, Spain,
as well as its neighboring countries,</i>

7
00:00:29.208 --> 00:00:31.916
<i>won't be able
to sustain dependent citizens until...</i>

8
00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.375
Get to your positions.
Come on. Same as last time.

9
00:00:37.458 --> 00:00:38.875
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

10
00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.916
Meet back at the trucks. Be careful, okay?

11
00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.392
- Let's go. Quickly and quietly.
- Run fast.

12
00:00:44.416 --> 00:00:48.166
Bring your things. Hurry. Come on.
Come on. Move it. Move it. Go, go, go.

13
00:00:49.208 --> 00:00:51.791
- Come on. Come on, quickly.
- Come on, Mia. Let's go.

14
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.833
- Hurry up. Quickly.
- Where?

15
00:00:56.916 --> 00:00:57.916
This way.

16
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.750
Move it. Move it.

17
00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.375
You two, follow me.
This way, guys. Come on!

18
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This way.

19
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.166
Faster.

20
00:01:18.416 --> 00:01:19.666
Faster. Move it.

21
00:01:21.541 --> 00:01:23.916
Come on. Let's go.

22
00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:27.583
- You okay?
- No.

23
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.166
Don't stop. Let's go.

24
00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.625
That way.
Let's go. Come on. Move. You first.

25
00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:38.125
Okay.

26
00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:49.500
- Nico.
- I'm here.

27
00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:53.875
- I don't fit. Fuck, I don't fit!
- You can do it.

28
00:01:53.958 --> 00:01:54.875
- Push me.
- Okay.

29
00:01:54.958 --> 00:01:56.500
Sorry.

30
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.875
- Are you okay? Yeah, you're okay.
- What?

31
00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.875
Back up!

32
00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:07.875
Let's go.

33
00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:09.458
Come on. Follow me.

34
00:02:11.875 --> 00:02:12.875
Hold my hand.

35
00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.166
Come on.

36
00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:18.333
Let's go, love.

37
00:02:19.958 --> 00:02:21.458
Stay back, don't move.

38
00:02:23.666 --> 00:02:24.666
Now!

39
00:02:27.625 --> 00:02:29.041
Through here. Almost there.

40
00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:31.416
<i>Attention! Put your hands in the air!</i>

41
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.083
<i>Stay where you are.</i>

42
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:36.458
<i>This is the police. You are under arrest.</i>

43
00:02:36.541 --> 00:02:37.541
Give me the money.

44
00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:39.958
You wait here.

45
00:02:40.416 --> 00:02:41.958
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

46
00:02:45.375 --> 00:02:47.215
Didn't tell me about these two.
Bring 'em over.

47
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:48.291
You, here.

48
00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:50.166
It's fine.

49
00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:54.625
- Is anything wrong?
- The conditions are riskier than expected.

50
00:02:54.708 --> 00:02:55.791
I need more money.

51
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:57.958
No, no, no. We don't have any more money.

52
00:03:01.708 --> 00:03:02.833
I see how this works.

53
00:03:04.666 --> 00:03:07.375
- Babe, give me your ring.
- No.

54
00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:10.416
{\an8}- Yes. You've got to.
- No. We gave them everything. Not my ring!

55
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.458
Mia, we've got to leave now.

56
00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:13.541
Take it.

57
00:03:13.958 --> 00:03:14.958
Come on.

58
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.125
Come on. We don't have all night. Move it.

59
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Good. This way.

60
00:03:19.458 --> 00:03:20.458
Safe travels.

61
00:03:24.416 --> 00:03:25.875
We're gonna make it.

62
00:03:27.041 --> 00:03:29.083
There it is. Our luxury liner.

63
00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:30.166
Move it, asshole!

64
00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:32.166
- Come on.
- Let's go!

65
00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.250
Now!

66
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:44.000
Step to the back.

67
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:45.500
- Are you okay?
- No.

68
00:03:58.958 --> 00:04:00.125
<i>There's no food!</i>

69
00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.250
<i>We accepted
the discourse about shortages.</i>

70
00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:05.125
<i>We accepted that we had to make sacrifices
for the common good.</i>

71
00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:07.666
<i>We accepted
that measures would be temporary.</i>

72
00:04:08.166 --> 00:04:09.000
<i>But what now?</i>

73
00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:10.958
<i>Look how far they've pushed us.</i>

74
00:04:11.041 --> 00:04:14.083
<i>First, they exterminated the elderly
to deal with the shortages.</i>

75
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:16.541
<i>Now they're targeting
pregnant women and kids.</i>

76
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:19.583
<i>Don't you see it? Pregnant women and kids!</i>

77
00:04:19.666 --> 00:04:21.708
<i>The regime isn't ending shortages.</i>

78
00:04:21.791 --> 00:04:23.375
Is there anything else on?

79
00:04:23.458 --> 00:04:25.625
<i>There are alternatives
to this massacre.</i>

80
00:04:25.708 --> 00:04:28.625
<i>Countries like Ireland,
Iceland, and Norway have managed to stop...</i>

81
00:04:28.708 --> 00:04:30.541
- Yeah, take it off.
- Okay.

82
00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:32.875
<i>Our country
must follow their example and help...</i>

83
00:04:34.458 --> 00:04:35.708
Let me see.

84
00:04:35.791 --> 00:04:37.458
Wow.

85
00:04:39.666 --> 00:04:40.666
That's better.

86
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.083
- Okay? Here.
- Yeah.

87
00:04:51.083 --> 00:04:52.541
Make him shut up.

88
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.125
Where'd you get this?

89
00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:07.041
Ah...

90
00:05:07.125 --> 00:05:08.125
Tell me.

91
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.750
It's a secret.

92
00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.583
Let's not have it now.

93
00:05:12.666 --> 00:05:14.875
Let's save it
and eat it when we get there.

94
00:05:14.958 --> 00:05:16.875
- To celebrate, right?
- Exactly.

95
00:05:22.083 --> 00:05:24.125
Do you think the regime will go there too?

96
00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:27.166
Ireland has ruled in opposition to it.

97
00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:30.250
Doesn't matter.
Governments are falling everywhere.

98
00:05:30.333 --> 00:05:32.583
- I'll tell you something about the Irish.
- What?

99
00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.958
It's impossible to overthrow them.

100
00:05:35.041 --> 00:05:37.333
- They drink dark beer.
- Right.

101
00:05:37.416 --> 00:05:38.875
Ireland won't give in.

102
00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:42.750
You're allowed to be afraid, you know.

103
00:05:43.791 --> 00:05:46.625
Everything will work out, you'll see. Hmm.

104
00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.583
- You don't know for sure.
- The worst part is over.

105
00:05:49.666 --> 00:05:50.708
You don't know that.

106
00:05:52.375 --> 00:05:53.833
There's one thing I do know.

107
00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:56.125
What?

108
00:05:56.666 --> 00:05:58.666
That I love you more than yesterday.

109
00:05:59.708 --> 00:06:00.958
But less than tomorrow.

110
00:06:23.666 --> 00:06:25.250
What's happening? Are we there?

111
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:29.041
We're leaving.

112
00:06:34.375 --> 00:06:36.750
Turn off the games.

113
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.333
Do you think she's pregnant?
She's all alone.

114
00:06:53.791 --> 00:06:55.875
If she's pregnant, she's not alone.

115
00:07:03.958 --> 00:07:05.375
How's our little Noa doing?

116
00:07:06.875 --> 00:07:08.208
I didn't know we decided yet.

117
00:07:08.291 --> 00:07:10.375
Noa.

118
00:07:10.458 --> 00:07:13.083
- What do you wanna name her?
- I hope it isn't a girl.

119
00:07:13.791 --> 00:07:14.791
I mean it.

120
00:07:15.708 --> 00:07:18.166
Well, I think she's a girl, a warrior.

121
00:07:19.166 --> 00:07:20.416
Just like her mother.

122
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.500
I don't feel her.

123
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:23.750
What?

124
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.666
She hasn't kicked me in two days.

125
00:07:28.666 --> 00:07:30.208
That's not good.

126
00:07:31.916 --> 00:07:33.083
Why didn't you tell me?

127
00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:34.958
Dunno.

128
00:07:40.416 --> 00:07:41.416
What are you doing?

129
00:07:42.208 --> 00:07:43.208
Haven't you noticed?

130
00:07:44.291 --> 00:07:46.250
She always pushes right here.

131
00:07:47.333 --> 00:07:48.625
I think this is a foot.

132
00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.000
How do you do it?

133
00:07:52.708 --> 00:07:53.708
What?

134
00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.875
Act like everything's fine.

135
00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:01.875
Like nothing's happened to us.

136
00:08:02.375 --> 00:08:03.708
You know that's not true.

137
00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:08.208
- You know, don't you?
- Mm-hmm.

138
00:08:14.625 --> 00:08:16.208
You brought my duck!

139
00:08:16.291 --> 00:08:18.583
Hi, there. What's wrong?

140
00:08:20.541 --> 00:08:22.333
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.

141
00:08:22.416 --> 00:08:24.416
No, no, no. Don't cry.

142
00:08:25.375 --> 00:08:28.125
- What does the duck say?
- Shh. Don't cry. You're okay.

143
00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.541
- Shh.
- Nico.

144
00:08:29.625 --> 00:08:30.625
Yeah?

145
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:35.000
What if she's alive,

146
00:08:35.583 --> 00:08:37.125
and we're leaving her behind?

147
00:08:39.125 --> 00:08:40.125
All alone.

148
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:43.250
She's not alive.

149
00:08:44.458 --> 00:08:45.458
They took her away,

150
00:08:46.583 --> 00:08:47.666
and they killed her.

151
00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000
Hmm.

152
00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:26.541
Hey! Hey! Hey!

153
00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:27.625
Nico! Nico!

154
00:09:28.958 --> 00:09:30.541
{\an8}Mia!

155
00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:32.708
Come on, now! Hurry up! Move it!

156
00:09:32.791 --> 00:09:34.208
Move it! Get in there now! Come on!

157
00:09:34.291 --> 00:09:36.791
What are you doin'?
Stop. There's too many. Back out!

158
00:09:36.875 --> 00:09:38.500
- Nico! Nico!
- Mia!

159
00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.583
Listen up! There's too many of you.

160
00:09:43.666 --> 00:09:45.250
There's another truck coming.

161
00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:47.791
- Half of you get out. Now!
- You heard him! It's too full.

162
00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:50.666
- Get some of 'em out!
- Come on! Come on! Get outta here!

163
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.625
Mia! Mia! Mia!

164
00:09:53.708 --> 00:09:55.208
- Nico!
- Get out!

165
00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:57.017
- Wait! Mia!
- Come on, keep moving. Hey, you!

166
00:09:57.041 --> 00:09:58.750
You can't stay!

167
00:09:58.833 --> 00:10:01.416
Hey. Are you deaf or what?
Get off the truck.

168
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:04.041
No, no. I was on this one, with my wife!

169
00:10:04.125 --> 00:10:05.250
- Get out!
- Get out!

170
00:10:06.875 --> 00:10:08.791
- Nico!
- The rest move back.

171
00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:11.666
- Stay back!
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no! Please! No!

172
00:10:21.583 --> 00:10:24.583
No. No, no, no. Nico. No, no, no.

173
00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:34.625
Keep moving! Come on! To the back!

174
00:10:35.125 --> 00:10:37.333
Nico. Nico.

175
00:10:39.916 --> 00:10:41.208
Nico.

176
00:10:41.291 --> 00:10:42.416
Nico. No.

177
00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.125
Nico, Nico.

178
00:10:44.208 --> 00:10:45.333
One-zero-seven green.

179
00:10:45.416 --> 00:10:47.833
No. No, please. Wait, wait, wait.

180
00:10:53.916 --> 00:10:55.625
<i>- Mia.</i>
- Babe, are you all right?

181
00:10:55.708 --> 00:10:57.166
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.</i>

182
00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.875
- Okay, Nico.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

183
00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:02.833
- How will we find each other again?
<i>- We're okay. My truck is behind yours.</i>

184
00:11:02.916 --> 00:11:04.333
- I can't do this alone.
<i>- What?</i>

185
00:11:04.416 --> 00:11:06.583
No, no.
I can't do it alone, I really can't.

186
00:11:06.666 --> 00:11:10.708
<i>Listen to me. You can't trust anyone.
Understand? Keep your things tucked away.</i>

187
00:11:10.791 --> 00:11:11.833
<i>Be careful, my love.</i>

188
00:11:12.333 --> 00:11:13.458
Yeah.

189
00:11:14.083 --> 00:11:15.708
<i>Did you hear me?</i>

190
00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:17.750
<i>Mia, are you there? Mia!</i>

191
00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:19.250
Nico, listen to me.

192
00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:21.541
Are you sure they're taking us
to the same location?

193
00:11:21.625 --> 00:11:23.666
<i>Yes, and when they stop, I'll escape.</i>

194
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:25.791
<i>Our ship is the only one
setting sail this week.</i>

195
00:11:25.875 --> 00:11:27.083
- Nico.
<i>- Yes?</i>

196
00:11:28.291 --> 00:11:29.708
I wanna be with you.

197
00:11:29.791 --> 00:11:31.000
<i>Me too. I love you, Mia.</i>

198
00:11:31.083 --> 00:11:33.083
<i>Don't worry,
everything's gonna be all right.</i>

199
00:11:33.166 --> 00:11:34.541
- Okay.
<i>- We're gonna be okay.</i>

200
00:11:35.041 --> 00:11:36.583
- Okay.
<i>- We'll talk soon, all right?</i>

201
00:11:36.666 --> 00:11:38.500
Don't go yet, don't hang up.

202
00:11:38.583 --> 00:11:40.958
<i>Love, we can't waste our batteries.</i>

203
00:11:41.041 --> 00:11:42.416
Please don't hang up yet.

204
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.583
<i>We'll be together again soon, you'll see.</i>

205
00:11:44.666 --> 00:11:45.791
- Nico.
<i>- Yeah?</i>

206
00:11:49.041 --> 00:11:49.916
Come soon.

207
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.958
<i>I will. As soon as I can.</i>

208
00:11:52.041 --> 00:11:53.083
Okay.

209
00:11:58.166 --> 00:12:00.541
What makes you think
you're better than us?

210
00:12:26.166 --> 00:12:27.375
Little girl, be quiet.

211
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000
GIVE US OUR CHILDREN BACK

212
00:12:46.083 --> 00:12:47.625
No, please, no!

213
00:12:51.083 --> 00:12:52.083
No...

214
00:12:59.375 --> 00:13:01.541
MURDERERS!
THIS IS NOT THE WAY

215
00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.333
What's going on?

216
00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.500
Hey.

217
00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.500
- What's going on?
- Move to the back.

218
00:14:09.375 --> 00:14:10.375
Don't talk.

219
00:14:31.666 --> 00:14:32.916
How you doin'?

220
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.041
Good, thanks.

221
00:14:34.125 --> 00:14:35.875
Step outside.
Bring your documents.

222
00:14:35.958 --> 00:14:37.250
Do I have to get out?

223
00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:39.291
- Transporting?
- Behind schedule.

224
00:14:40.875 --> 00:14:43.208
Very good.
Come with me to the back, please.

225
00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:44.333
Uh, sure.

226
00:14:54.166 --> 00:14:55.583
This is the entire load?

227
00:14:55.666 --> 00:14:56.666
Yes.

228
00:14:57.583 --> 00:14:59.083
You can't tell me what you're moving?

229
00:15:00.041 --> 00:15:01.833
Small load. All in the manifest.

230
00:15:01.916 --> 00:15:04.000
I know what it says.

231
00:15:04.541 --> 00:15:06.083
Problem is you don't.

232
00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:08.541
Look, it's been a long week.
I log a lot of miles.

233
00:15:08.625 --> 00:15:10.125
Lots of shipments.

234
00:15:10.208 --> 00:15:11.208
Stop!

235
00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:13.166
Is there a problem?

236
00:15:20.375 --> 00:15:21.666
Another one's pullin' in.

237
00:15:30.750 --> 00:15:31.750
He can park there.

238
00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:35.958
Am I clear?

239
00:15:36.041 --> 00:15:37.041
You in a rush?

240
00:15:38.416 --> 00:15:41.208
Uh, it's just if... if I'm late,
I'll be penalized.

241
00:15:41.916 --> 00:15:43.916
Well, I'm required
to check inside the truck.

242
00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:48.208
But is that necessary?
I'm barely carrying anything.

243
00:15:48.291 --> 00:15:50.791
Don't worry about it.
I'll write you a note.

244
00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.041
Travis, back here.

245
00:17:19.708 --> 00:17:21.000
Do it!

246
00:17:35.708 --> 00:17:37.458
Great, thank you.

247
00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:38.541
Well done.

248
00:17:40.541 --> 00:17:41.541
You can come out now.

249
00:17:42.458 --> 00:17:44.625
Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you.

250
00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:47.958
You won't come out?

251
00:17:58.083 --> 00:18:00.875
I know that the austerity measures
have been cruel.

252
00:18:00.958 --> 00:18:03.458
They're especially hard
on women and children.

253
00:18:03.541 --> 00:18:06.666
I understand
if you don't think you can trust me.

254
00:18:07.666 --> 00:18:10.416
It's hard to know
who to trust, right? Hmm?

255
00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.916
Not those who forced you
into this container.

256
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.281
They stuffed you in here
with barely enough air to breathe

257
00:18:15.333 --> 00:18:17.708
and robbed you
of all the money you had left.

258
00:18:17.791 --> 00:18:19.083
And they promised you...

259
00:18:20.166 --> 00:18:23.041
...you could have a better life
in a better place.

260
00:18:23.125 --> 00:18:24.208
They lied.

261
00:18:24.291 --> 00:18:26.041
A better place doesn't exist.

262
00:18:26.125 --> 00:18:27.291
So you should come out.

263
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.208
Because if you don't, I'll have to shoot.

264
00:18:31.416 --> 00:18:34.833
Damn it. Don't make me give that order.
I've had to give it so many times.

265
00:18:36.041 --> 00:18:38.083
I can save your lives.

266
00:18:40.583 --> 00:18:41.583
Well, I tried.

267
00:19:00.666 --> 00:19:02.375
Come. Take my hand.

268
00:19:03.416 --> 00:19:05.625
Hey! Good for you!

269
00:19:07.458 --> 00:19:09.250
Come on up! Take my hand!

270
00:19:10.166 --> 00:19:11.916
All right, boys. You know what to do.

271
00:19:42.791 --> 00:19:45.000
Puppy!

272
00:19:58.125 --> 00:20:00.958
Get the bodies out of here
and get rid of all their shit.

273
00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:17.000
Take this one.

274
00:20:21.166 --> 00:20:22.333
Good enough. Let's go.

275
00:20:23.708 --> 00:20:25.333
- All good, boss.
- Great.

276
00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:54.625
Nico. You've gotta hide. Hide, Nico.

277
00:20:54.708 --> 00:20:55.833
They killed everyone.

278
00:20:57.041 --> 00:21:01.250
You've gotta hide.
They're gonna kill you. Hide, Nico.

279
00:21:57.708 --> 00:22:00.916
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

280
00:22:11.291 --> 00:22:12.291
Nico.

281
00:22:13.875 --> 00:22:15.500
I'm okay and I'm at the port.

282
00:22:15.583 --> 00:22:16.833
Where are you?

283
00:22:17.458 --> 00:22:19.375
Where are you? Why don't you pick up?

284
00:22:20.958 --> 00:22:22.000
Just call me.

285
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:08.000
- Watch out, it's gonna come loose.
- Help!

286
00:24:09.375 --> 00:24:11.083
I need help!

287
00:24:15.041 --> 00:24:16.708
Come on, let's go!

288
00:24:25.416 --> 00:24:26.958
It's gonna fall! Watch out!

289
00:24:27.041 --> 00:24:28.041
Please help!

290
00:24:29.458 --> 00:24:32.291
Hey! Hey! I'm in here!

291
00:24:33.125 --> 00:24:35.208
Let me out! Please, I'm here!

292
00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:36.750
Hey! Hey!

293
00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:38.000
I'm in here!

294
00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Help!

295
00:24:49.083 --> 00:24:51.041
- Help!
- It's going to fall!

296
00:24:51.125 --> 00:24:52.125
Please, help me!

297
00:24:52.208 --> 00:24:55.916
- Is somebody there?
- Yes, I'm here! Help me, please!

298
00:25:20.916 --> 00:25:21.916
God.

299
00:25:39.333 --> 00:25:40.333
Help.

300
00:26:44.583 --> 00:26:45.583
What?

301
00:27:05.833 --> 00:27:07.750
No, no, no, no. No.

302
00:27:08.541 --> 00:27:09.541
No way.

303
00:27:43.666 --> 00:27:44.666
Please.

304
00:27:45.208 --> 00:27:47.166
Please. Please.

305
00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:48.416
Aw, come on.

306
00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:06.583
ENTER PIN NUMBER

307
00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:13.791
INCORRECT PIN

308
00:28:19.416 --> 00:28:20.416
PIN BLOCKED

309
00:29:16.416 --> 00:29:17.416
Okay.

310
00:29:27.166 --> 00:29:28.166
Fuck.

311
00:29:31.541 --> 00:29:32.583
Shit.

312
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.333
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

313
00:30:38.375 --> 00:30:39.375
Oh, no.

314
00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:01.791
What?

315
00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.208
Hey!

316
00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Hey!

317
00:31:08.291 --> 00:31:09.333
Nico, I'm over here!

318
00:31:09.916 --> 00:31:10.833
Nico!

319
00:31:10.916 --> 00:31:12.541
Over here!

320
00:31:13.041 --> 00:31:14.166
No, no, no!

321
00:31:14.250 --> 00:31:15.250
Hey!

322
00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:18.291
Nico! Nico!

323
00:31:19.625 --> 00:31:21.041
Nico!

324
00:31:22.083 --> 00:31:23.000
Nico!

325
00:31:23.083 --> 00:31:26.166
Where are you?
Hang on! Just hang on! Wait.

326
00:31:27.708 --> 00:31:28.750
Okay.

327
00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:34.208
Nico!

328
00:31:34.833 --> 00:31:36.791
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Wait!

329
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:41.166
Wait. Wait!

330
00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:43.291
Nico!

331
00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:45.708
It's me. Come on, answer the phone.

332
00:31:45.791 --> 00:31:48.541
Please, answer me. No, no, no, no.

333
00:31:48.625 --> 00:31:49.958
No!

334
00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:51.291
No! Please, I'm here!

335
00:31:51.375 --> 00:31:53.500
No!

336
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:58.500
<i>Hello, this is Nico.
I can't talk now, but try me again later.</i>

340
00:33:46.583 --> 00:33:47.583
Huh.

341
00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:49.125
Huh?

342
00:33:53.833 --> 00:33:55.000
Are you there?

343
00:33:59.541 --> 00:34:00.541
No.

344
00:34:03.791 --> 00:34:04.791
No.

345
00:34:09.958 --> 00:34:10.958
Hello?

346
00:34:18.291 --> 00:34:19.291
Hi.

347
00:35:52.500 --> 00:35:54.000
No! What?

348
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:56.375
What's happening?

349
00:36:32.750 --> 00:36:33.750
Okay.

350
00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:44.500
Come on.

351
00:36:52.666 --> 00:36:53.666
Come on!

352
00:37:03.291 --> 00:37:05.000
Really? More Tupperware?

353
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.291
Fucking Tupperware! Shit.

354
00:37:23.833 --> 00:37:24.833
Okay.

355
00:37:28.708 --> 00:37:29.791
Brilliant.

356
00:38:01.166 --> 00:38:04.916
DAY 2

357
00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:13.833
MAXIMUM

358
00:38:13.916 --> 00:38:14.916
All right.

359
00:38:17.958 --> 00:38:19.833
911

360
00:38:22.666 --> 00:38:23.666
Hello?

361
00:38:27.625 --> 00:38:28.625
No signal.

362
00:39:07.666 --> 00:39:09.041
What? Oh!

363
00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:10.625
UNKNOWN NUMBER

364
00:39:10.708 --> 00:39:13.458
<i>- Mia. Mia, sweetheart.</i>
- Nico?

365
00:39:13.541 --> 00:39:15.541
<i>- Yes.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

366
00:39:15.625 --> 00:39:17.083
<i>Oh my God! Thank God!</i>

367
00:39:17.166 --> 00:39:20.250
Nico, I didn't think you were alive.
Love, are you okay?

368
00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:22.166
<i>I'm sorry I couldn't call.
My battery ran out.</i>

369
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.875
<i>The driver fucked us over.
He left us outside the city limits.</i>

370
00:39:24.958 --> 00:39:26.375
<i>It'll take a few days to catch up.</i>

371
00:39:26.458 --> 00:39:28.500
No. Listen to me.
Something's happening to me, Nico.

372
00:39:28.583 --> 00:39:31.333
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
- I'm trapped in here and I can't get out.

373
00:39:31.416 --> 00:39:33.583
<i>I'm coming to you.
I'm coming. I'll be there soon.</i>

374
00:39:33.666 --> 00:39:37.041
No, no, no. You've gotta listen to me.
I'm not... You won't...

375
00:39:37.125 --> 00:39:38.333
<i>What? What's going on?</i>

376
00:39:38.416 --> 00:39:39.583
I'm not on the boat.

377
00:39:39.666 --> 00:39:41.625
<i>- What do you mean?</i>
- I'm not on the boat.

378
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:44.625
- My container's in the ocean.
<i>- Wait. Your... What? Where are you?</i>

379
00:39:45.208 --> 00:39:48.750
I don't know. I'm floating in the ocean.
I'm drifting. I don't know where.

380
00:39:48.833 --> 00:39:50.875
I'm okay for now,
but the water's seeping in.

381
00:39:50.958 --> 00:39:54.333
<i>Oh my God, Mia.
Can you see anything outside?</i>

382
00:39:54.416 --> 00:39:56.851
Yes, I can see, but all there is is water.
There's just water.

383
00:39:56.875 --> 00:39:58.675
<i>- There's nothing else?</i>
- Nothing. Just water.

384
00:39:58.708 --> 00:40:00.833
- I'm in the middle of the ocean, Nico.
<i>- Fuck!</i>

385
00:40:02.666 --> 00:40:04.500
Say something. I'm scared.

386
00:40:05.333 --> 00:40:09.125
<i>Just don't worry, Mia.
I'll rescue you. I promise.</i>

387
00:40:09.208 --> 00:40:10.916
- Nico...
<i>- Just try to hang in there.</i>

388
00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.208
- I'm trying, but I...
<i>- Do it for the baby.</i>

389
00:40:13.291 --> 00:40:15.250
I don't think I can do this much longer.

390
00:40:15.333 --> 00:40:17.253
<i>- You can do it.</i>
- I just miss her so much, Nico.

391
00:40:17.291 --> 00:40:18.375
<i>No, no, no, no. No, no.</i>

392
00:40:18.458 --> 00:40:21.208
<i>- My love, don't do this. Not now.</i>
- I messed up again.

393
00:40:22.041 --> 00:40:24.083
<i>It's not your fault. Do you understand?</i>

394
00:40:24.583 --> 00:40:26.750
<i>What happened to Uma was not your fault.</i>

395
00:40:26.833 --> 00:40:28.041
<i>- Sweetheart.</i>
- It wasn't?

396
00:40:28.125 --> 00:40:30.833
<i>You're the strongest person
I've ever known.</i>

397
00:40:30.916 --> 00:40:32.708
<i>- Promise you won't give up?</i>
- Yes.

398
00:40:33.541 --> 00:40:34.791
<i>- Mia...</i>
- Yeah?

399
00:40:35.958 --> 00:40:37.250
<i>I love you more than yesterday.</i>

400
00:40:38.208 --> 00:40:39.625
But less than tomorrow.

401
00:40:39.708 --> 00:40:42.458
<i>I will call you
as soon as I figure out a plan.</i>

402
00:40:42.541 --> 00:40:44.416
- Find me. Bye.
<i>- Don't lose your phone.</i>

403
00:40:57.458 --> 00:41:00.791
Oh no, no, no, no, no. Not now.
Not now. Don't do this right now.

404
00:41:00.875 --> 00:41:03.416
Just wait. Help Mommy and wait.

405
00:41:04.166 --> 00:41:06.875
Daddy's on his way.
Wait for Daddy to come.

406
00:41:55.666 --> 00:41:57.000
No. No, no, no.

407
00:41:57.791 --> 00:41:59.833
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

408
00:41:59.916 --> 00:42:05.708
Please, please wait. Wait a bit longer.
Please wait, please wait a little longer.

409
00:42:08.625 --> 00:42:10.958
I wanted you to wait!

410
00:42:15.625 --> 00:42:16.625
Nico!

411
00:42:19.375 --> 00:42:20.375
No!

412
00:42:23.791 --> 00:42:25.583
Ah! No, no, no!

413
00:42:26.833 --> 00:42:27.833
No!

414
00:44:20.833 --> 00:44:23.208
What? Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

415
00:44:25.375 --> 00:44:29.083
Breathe, please. Please. Come on.

416
00:44:29.583 --> 00:44:31.958
Come on, breathe. Breathe. Breathe.

417
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:35.291
Oh please, breathe.

418
00:45:27.583 --> 00:45:28.625
Mm-hmm.

419
00:45:37.166 --> 00:45:38.708
Oh! Oh!

420
00:46:08.458 --> 00:46:11.875
DAY 2

421
00:46:12.458 --> 00:46:14.250
DAY 3

422
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:16.958
Honey. Sweetie.

423
00:46:18.208 --> 00:46:19.208
What's wrong?

424
00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:22.166
Want a fresh diaper? Yes?

425
00:46:25.666 --> 00:46:27.750
All right, all right.
It's okay. I can hear you.

426
00:46:27.833 --> 00:46:29.416
You're so loud. I know, I know.

427
00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:33.000
You're hungry, aren't you?
Okay, it's coming. That's right. Hang on.

428
00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:36.916
It's coming.

429
00:46:38.833 --> 00:46:41.166
Come on, sweetie. I know you're hungry.

430
00:46:41.916 --> 00:46:42.916
Come on, lovie.

431
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:45.625
You're hungry, but you won't eat.

432
00:46:46.791 --> 00:46:47.625
It's okay.

433
00:46:47.708 --> 00:46:50.666
Okay, okay, okay.
Everything's all right.

434
00:46:53.916 --> 00:46:55.458
Mommy needs to eat too.

435
00:46:58.291 --> 00:46:59.375
Mm...

436
00:47:09.875 --> 00:47:12.958
No fucking way. Fuck.

437
00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:21.833
Yes, I know, I know, it's okay.

438
00:47:23.708 --> 00:47:26.375
All right. Come on.

439
00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.791
Honey, why won't you eat? Okay...

440
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:39.125
Hey, listen, listen, listen, listen.

441
00:47:39.208 --> 00:47:42.166
Your job is to eat,
and my job is to take care of you, okay?

442
00:47:42.250 --> 00:47:44.875
We're gonna get out of here, promise.

443
00:47:44.958 --> 00:47:46.750
Please don't be so sad, honey.

444
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.791
Hey! That's enough now!

445
00:48:10.875 --> 00:48:14.833
I have to do this so we can get out
of here and get some help. Okay?

446
00:48:14.916 --> 00:48:16.166
Be quiet and let me work!

447
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:18.000
Try to be patient for me, please.

448
00:48:27.708 --> 00:48:29.333
Okay. I'm coming.

449
00:48:31.166 --> 00:48:32.916
Okay, my love. I'm here.

450
00:48:33.583 --> 00:48:34.875
Honey, it's okay.

451
00:48:34.958 --> 00:48:36.791
Okay. You're starving.

452
00:48:40.333 --> 00:48:41.333
Honey...

453
00:48:42.958 --> 00:48:47.041
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on. Come on.

454
00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:51.166
Be quiet! Stop! Stop this! Enough!

455
00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:53.833
You have to eat or you will die!
You wanna die?

456
00:48:53.916 --> 00:48:55.291
{\an8}Huh? Is that what you want?

457
00:48:59.333 --> 00:49:01.208
{\an8}I'm sorry. I'm sorry, baby.

458
00:49:01.291 --> 00:49:04.541
{\an8}Mommy loves you.
I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't mean it.

459
00:49:04.625 --> 00:49:06.041
{\an8}I'm gonna take care of you.

460
00:49:07.666 --> 00:49:08.833
I know, I know.

461
00:49:08.916 --> 00:49:10.083
I'm so sorry.

462
00:49:11.333 --> 00:49:12.333
It's all right.

463
00:49:32.333 --> 00:49:33.833
Come here, my little warrior.

464
00:49:35.125 --> 00:49:36.500
Let's try again. Okay?

465
00:49:36.583 --> 00:49:37.583
Still hungry?

466
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:40.458
I know, and we're gonna try again.

467
00:49:42.833 --> 00:49:46.291
You've been waiting for so long.
I'm sorry it took so long.

468
00:49:46.375 --> 00:49:48.041
I know, I know, I know.

469
00:49:48.958 --> 00:49:49.958
Ready?

470
00:49:51.583 --> 00:49:53.375
Here we go, sweetheart.

471
00:49:53.458 --> 00:49:54.458
That's it.

472
00:49:54.833 --> 00:49:56.708
Latch on for Mommy.

473
00:50:15.791 --> 00:50:17.333
Keep drinking for Mommy.

474
00:50:18.958 --> 00:50:20.125
Mommy's milk came.

475
00:50:21.291 --> 00:50:22.291
Finally.

476
00:50:23.916 --> 00:50:24.916
That's right.

477
00:50:27.416 --> 00:50:30.333
Good girl.
We're good, we're good, we're good.

478
00:50:52.166 --> 00:50:53.166
Mm...

479
00:50:53.833 --> 00:50:54.833
Mm.

480
00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:02.166
Come on!

481
00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.500
All right. Almost there.

482
00:52:23.458 --> 00:52:25.791
Huh? What's going on?

483
00:52:25.875 --> 00:52:28.625
No. Come on!

484
00:52:29.625 --> 00:52:30.916
Please work.

485
00:52:31.666 --> 00:52:32.666
Let's go.

486
00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:34.583
Come on!

487
00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.000
No.

488
00:52:38.833 --> 00:52:39.875
No!

489
00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.000
No...

490
00:53:27.458 --> 00:53:29.083
Yes!

491
00:53:30.833 --> 00:53:31.833
Come on.

492
00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.583
No. No.

493
00:53:34.666 --> 00:53:36.375
Please work. Come on, work!

494
00:53:39.125 --> 00:53:40.708
Come back! Please!

495
00:53:40.791 --> 00:53:42.375
Don't do this to me!

496
00:53:42.458 --> 00:53:45.250
Ugh! Come on! No! No. no. no. Hey!

497
00:53:45.333 --> 00:53:46.333
Ugh.

498
00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:47.416
No!

499
00:54:40.500 --> 00:54:43.875
It's all right.
It's all right, sweetie. I know.

500
00:54:45.333 --> 00:54:48.791
That's better, isn't it?
Shh, there, that's better.

501
00:54:49.583 --> 00:54:50.625
Much, much better.

502
00:55:08.291 --> 00:55:09.291
Mm...

503
00:55:12.166 --> 00:55:13.166
Hm...

504
00:55:14.958 --> 00:55:15.958
Mm...

505
00:55:53.333 --> 00:55:54.333
Eh...

506
00:56:56.250 --> 00:56:57.833
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

507
00:56:57.916 --> 00:57:01.125
Don't cry. It's okay.
I'm here, sweetie. Mommy's here.

508
00:57:01.833 --> 00:57:03.333
Don't worry. I'm here.

509
00:57:06.958 --> 00:57:08.875
Don't be afraid. It's okay, it's okay.

510
00:57:12.375 --> 00:57:13.375
Okay.

511
00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Go away!

512
00:57:20.333 --> 00:57:21.583
Get outta here!

513
00:57:40.166 --> 00:57:41.541
Okay. It's gone.

514
00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.750
I've got you. I'm here.

515
00:57:46.041 --> 00:57:47.041
It's gone.

516
00:57:49.125 --> 00:57:50.125
It's gone.

517
00:57:52.125 --> 00:57:53.250
DAY 6

518
00:58:08.083 --> 00:58:09.083
Huh?

519
00:59:25.666 --> 00:59:26.666
Mm.

520
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.208
- Mommy?
- Uma, my darling.

521
01:00:25.791 --> 01:00:27.625
Uma, please come here.

522
01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.708
Come closer. Please. I wanna see you.

523
01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Hi, honey.

524
01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:42.541
Mommy, can we go home now, please?

525
01:00:44.083 --> 01:00:46.291
I miss you so much, Uma.

526
01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:49.291
Mommy, why did you let them take me away?

527
01:00:50.541 --> 01:00:51.583
I'm sorry.

528
01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:56.583
I'm sorry.

529
01:00:57.791 --> 01:00:59.000
It was my fault.

530
01:01:00.416 --> 01:01:03.541
I just wanted to play with the airplane.

531
01:01:05.583 --> 01:01:07.791
I know, it was a mistake.

532
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.041
No, stay.

533
01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:25.625
I'm sorry.

534
01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.541
It was my fault. I messed up.

535
01:01:33.916 --> 01:01:35.000
I'm sorry.

536
01:01:39.416 --> 01:01:40.666
It wasn't your fault.

537
01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:53.833
It wasn't your fault.

538
01:02:59.250 --> 01:03:01.291
Mommy will
get you out of here, okay?

539
01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:12.333
Sweetheart. Look at the world.

540
01:05:14.500 --> 01:05:16.250
Up above is the sky.

541
01:05:16.333 --> 01:05:18.166
Down below is the sea.

542
01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:22.041
And very far over there
is where we're going.

543
01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.541
Nico, where are you?

544
01:05:40.208 --> 01:05:41.750
Feels good to be outside, right?

545
01:05:42.250 --> 01:05:44.625
Yeah, you seem much happier.

546
01:05:44.708 --> 01:05:46.416
You like the sun and fresh air.

547
01:06:07.791 --> 01:06:09.250
This way. Over here.

548
01:06:09.333 --> 01:06:10.333
Here.

549
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.791
Come on. Over here. This way.

550
01:07:59.458 --> 01:08:00.666
Here. I'm here.

551
01:08:42.625 --> 01:08:46.208
Shh! It's okay, my love.
I'm here. It's okay. It's okay.

552
01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:47.416
I'm here. I'm here.

553
01:09:08.166 --> 01:09:09.916
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

554
01:09:11.541 --> 01:09:12.583
I've got this.

555
01:09:33.708 --> 01:09:35.541
Oh.

556
01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:38.541
Don't worry, sweetie.

557
01:11:11.458 --> 01:11:12.458
Come on.

558
01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:15.541
Come on, come on.

559
01:11:18.166 --> 01:11:19.166
Come on.

560
01:11:20.416 --> 01:11:22.958
Come on, come on. Come, come, come, come.

561
01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Come on.

562
01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.291
Come on.

563
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:55.125
Don't give me that look. I'm desperate.
You know what it feels like.

564
01:12:07.166 --> 01:12:08.458
MAXIMUM

565
01:12:08.541 --> 01:12:13.041
DAY 9

566
01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.875
Good job. You're Mommy's big girl.

567
01:12:54.083 --> 01:12:55.250
It's mini bath time.

568
01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:20.541
Where are you? Where are you?
Call me. Come on, Nico. Call me.

569
01:13:20.625 --> 01:13:22.583
Call me, please. Call me!

570
01:13:46.833 --> 01:13:50.583
DAY 12

571
01:14:09.541 --> 01:14:10.791
Look, this is me.

572
01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:11.875
At school.

573
01:14:13.166 --> 01:14:15.791
With one of my students.
Did I tell you I'm a teacher?

574
01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.500
This is your daddy. His name's Nico.

575
01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:21.416
He's at work, in our store.

576
01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:26.375
We were forced to close the store
because there wasn't much food to sell.

577
01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:31.625
At the end, there wasn't anything at all.
But people came to visit him anyway.

578
01:14:32.208 --> 01:14:33.666
Because he cared about them.

579
01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:36.541
I know he'll find a way
to get us out of here

580
01:14:36.625 --> 01:14:39.958
because... he always knows what to do.

581
01:14:44.833 --> 01:14:47.083
This is your grandma, Noa.

582
01:14:48.041 --> 01:14:50.083
Do you like that name? Noa.

583
01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:52.083
I think it's beautiful.

584
01:14:52.166 --> 01:14:54.708
It means "long life." Spelled with an H.

585
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:57.291
But it's prettier without it.

586
01:14:57.375 --> 01:14:59.583
In Noah's Ark, that's a story,

587
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:02.291
they survived and got to land.

588
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.166
There are animals in it.
I'll read it to you some day.

589
01:15:11.833 --> 01:15:12.875
This is Uma.

590
01:15:14.041 --> 01:15:15.916
You wanna know about her, don't you?

591
01:15:20.416 --> 01:15:23.500
Well, you know,
you have the same eyes as she did.

592
01:15:23.583 --> 01:15:24.583
Exactly.

593
01:15:24.958 --> 01:15:27.958
And when she was a baby,
the shape of her face was just like yours.

594
01:15:28.041 --> 01:15:30.416
She wanted to be an airplane pilot.

595
01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:33.125
She liked to say "airplane pilot."

596
01:15:33.708 --> 01:15:35.375
You would've had fun with her.

597
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:40.375
What happened is that when...

598
01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:45.250
...when the regime took over,

599
01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.875
we were forced to lock ourselves
inside the house.

600
01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:50.416
And your daddy would go out
to get us food.

601
01:15:51.250 --> 01:15:53.791
At first, it was fine,
but as time went on...

602
01:15:56.916 --> 01:15:59.458
Uma wanted to go outside because...

603
01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:04.416
because a girl can't stand
being locked up for too long

604
01:16:05.583 --> 01:16:07.250
in her house, you know.

605
01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:14.625
There wasn't enough room to play,

606
01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:17.375
so one day,

607
01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.916
she kept begging me
and insisting we go out.

608
01:16:24.083 --> 01:16:25.333
And, um,

609
01:16:25.916 --> 01:16:27.250
I said, "Okay."

610
01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:31.291
We were only outside five minutes,
but they took her.

611
01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:42.000
It was all my fault.

612
01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:44.041
I should've known better.

613
01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:47.416
I messed up.

614
01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.750
What's wrong?

615
01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:12.583
What's wrong? Are you okay?

616
01:17:12.666 --> 01:17:14.125
You're freezing.

617
01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:27.500
There we are.

618
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:36.291
You're snug as a bug in a rug like that.

619
01:17:37.291 --> 01:17:38.750
My beanie looks cute on you.

620
01:17:41.583 --> 01:17:43.625
You'll feel much better tomorrow, okay?

621
01:17:44.791 --> 01:17:46.000
You're all bundled up.

622
01:17:47.416 --> 01:17:48.541
Warm and cozy.

623
01:20:03.541 --> 01:20:07.000
Sweet pea. All right. I got you.

624
01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.625
DAY 12

625
01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.166
No, no, no.

626
01:20:19.250 --> 01:20:21.041
MAXIMUM

627
01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:06.666
Nico! Nico!

628
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:08.833
Oh, come on, come on, connect.
Please, come on.

629
01:21:08.916 --> 01:21:11.708
Please work. Come on, connect. Connect.

630
01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:14.833
Nico. Nico.

631
01:21:14.916 --> 01:21:16.875
<i>- Mia.</i>
- Can you hear me?

632
01:21:16.958 --> 01:21:19.541
<i>- Uh, yes, at last.</i>
- It's finally you, my love.

633
01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.000
I'm so sorry I couldn't call you.

634
01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:23.333
I didn't have a signal.
And my cell is broken.

635
01:21:23.416 --> 01:21:25.916
No, no, I mean the screen is broken.
Where are you?

636
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:28.291
<i>- Listen to me, please, my love.</i>
- What's wrong, Nico?

637
01:21:29.500 --> 01:21:31.166
<i>I won't be able to come for you.</i>

638
01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:33.375
<i>You'll have to make it on your own.</i>

639
01:21:34.625 --> 01:21:35.625
<i>Promise me you will.</i>

640
01:21:37.250 --> 01:21:38.250
<i>Promise.</i>

641
01:21:38.750 --> 01:21:40.458
Nico, what's wrong?

642
01:21:41.041 --> 01:21:43.625
Please, Nico. I'm scared. What's wrong?

643
01:21:43.708 --> 01:21:44.750
My love, tell me.

644
01:21:48.791 --> 01:21:51.583
- Nico...
<i>- I'm... I'm hiding in a container.</i>

645
01:21:52.458 --> 01:21:56.541
<i>I snuck onto a ship, but they found me.</i>

646
01:21:57.208 --> 01:21:59.125
<i>And when I ran, they shot me.</i>

647
01:22:01.125 --> 01:22:02.375
Are you hurt?

648
01:22:03.625 --> 01:22:05.083
<i>I'm losing so much blood.</i>

649
01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.500
- What?
<i>- My love...</i>

650
01:22:09.250 --> 01:22:12.458
- Honey?
<i>- I just... I just wanted to say goodbye.</i>

651
01:22:14.875 --> 01:22:17.125
<i>And I want you to know that I fought hard.</i>

652
01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:20.458
<i>I fought hard. As hard as I could.</i>

653
01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:23.041
<i>I promise I did.</i>

654
01:22:23.125 --> 01:22:25.750
<i>And... you were right.</i>

655
01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:27.625
<i>You were always right.</i>

656
01:22:28.458 --> 01:22:29.708
<i>I'm too optimistic.</i>

657
01:22:30.541 --> 01:22:31.916
<i>We should've stayed.</i>

658
01:22:33.083 --> 01:22:35.833
- No. No. Nico, listen to me.
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>

659
01:22:35.916 --> 01:22:37.196
- Listen to me, Nico.
<i>- So sorry.</i>

660
01:22:37.250 --> 01:22:38.541
Please, my love, listen to me.

661
01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:40.750
- You saved our lives.
<i>- How?</i>

662
01:22:40.833 --> 01:22:44.041
- Understand?
<i>- How? You said "our lives"?</i>

663
01:22:44.125 --> 01:22:45.833
Yes, my love, she's here.

664
01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:50.750
She's here, Nico. She was born.

665
01:22:52.875 --> 01:22:54.583
She's a beautiful little girl.

666
01:22:54.666 --> 01:22:56.125
<i>- That's amazing.</i>
- Yeah.

667
01:22:56.208 --> 01:22:58.375
<i>A girl, huh? See, I knew it.</i>

668
01:22:59.541 --> 01:23:00.625
<i>Are you okay?</i>

669
01:23:00.708 --> 01:23:03.875
- Yeah. We're both fine. We're both fine.
<i>- I wish I were with you.</i>

670
01:23:03.958 --> 01:23:07.208
You're here, Nico.
You are. You've been here the whole time.

671
01:23:07.291 --> 01:23:09.583
You were here during my labor,

672
01:23:09.666 --> 01:23:12.375
you were here
when I finally opened the container.

673
01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:16.250
I promised I wouldn't give up
and I fought.

674
01:23:16.333 --> 01:23:20.458
I fought so hard.
And you're here when I sing to her.

675
01:23:20.541 --> 01:23:21.875
You're always here with me.

676
01:23:21.958 --> 01:23:25.458
<i>- What? You, sing?</i>
- Yes.

677
01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:30.458
<i>Sweetheart,
what does she look like?</i>

678
01:23:32.708 --> 01:23:33.708
She looks like you.

679
01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:36.875
She's so beautiful,
she's strong, and funny.

680
01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:39.833
She makes me laugh,
she's caring just like you.

681
01:23:40.541 --> 01:23:42.166
You know what? She's right here.

682
01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.541
I'll put the phone next to her
so she can hear your voice.

683
01:23:46.625 --> 01:23:48.125
<i>- Okay.</i>
- Sweet pea,

684
01:23:48.208 --> 01:23:49.666
your daddy wants to talk to you.

685
01:23:49.750 --> 01:23:51.750
He's on the phone. Say something.

686
01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:57.791
<i>Hello, how's my princess? I'm your daddy.</i>

687
01:23:59.125 --> 01:24:02.166
<i>I'm the pesky guy
who pushed your foot all the time</i>

688
01:24:02.250 --> 01:24:04.166
<i>when you were in your mommy's tummy.</i>

689
01:24:05.416 --> 01:24:07.708
<i>Okay. Now listen.</i>

690
01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:10.333
<i>I'm gonna tell you a secret.</i>

691
01:24:12.083 --> 01:24:14.958
<i>If you ever feel sad
and confused about life,</i>

692
01:24:15.875 --> 01:24:19.875
<i>close your eyes
and sit in your mom's lap for a while.</i>

693
01:24:21.041 --> 01:24:26.250
<i>You'll see that when you're in her arms,
everything's all right. Always.</i>

694
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:33.000
Did you hear her? She's brilliant.

695
01:24:34.708 --> 01:24:35.875
Her name is Noa.

696
01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:37.833
<i>Noa?</i>

697
01:24:39.250 --> 01:24:40.250
<i>Are you sure?</i>

698
01:24:42.416 --> 01:24:44.166
She looks like a Noa.

699
01:24:44.250 --> 01:24:47.791
So as it turns out,
Noa was the perfect name for her.

700
01:24:49.791 --> 01:24:50.791
Nico.

701
01:24:51.541 --> 01:24:52.541
<i>Yeah?</i>

702
01:24:53.416 --> 01:24:55.291
Nico, I love you more than yesterday.

703
01:24:56.583 --> 01:24:58.000
<i>But less than tomorrow.</i>

01:27:15.833 --> 01:27:18.958
DAY 14
I'M SICK OF EATING FISH

710
01:27:19.041 --> 01:27:20.916
DAY 20
SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING ALL DAY

711
01:27:25.666 --> 01:27:27.625
DAY 24
I CAN'T STOP THE WATER

712
01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:30.125
I HAVE TO LIVE UP TOP

713
01:28:13.958 --> 01:28:15.333
It's okay. I gotcha.

714
01:28:26.583 --> 01:28:27.583
Hey!

715
01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:30.083
Noa!

716
01:28:30.583 --> 01:28:32.791
That was a seagull.

717
01:28:32.875 --> 01:28:34.500
You know what that means, honey?

718
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:51.875
MAXIMUM

719
01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:07.125
Okay.

720
01:29:13.291 --> 01:29:14.458
Huh?

721
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:18.791
No!

722
01:29:53.500 --> 01:29:54.500
No.

723
01:29:56.250 --> 01:29:57.666
You're fucking kidding.

724
01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:31.125
What's happening?

725
01:30:32.083 --> 01:30:33.083
No!

726
01:31:49.708 --> 01:31:50.875
Noa!

727
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.833
Noa!

728
01:31:54.916 --> 01:31:55.958
Noa!

729
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:57.875
Noa!

730
01:32:02.708 --> 01:32:03.750
Noa!

731
01:32:09.125 --> 01:32:10.708
No. Go away!

732
01:32:10.791 --> 01:32:12.375
Noa. Noa!

733
01:32:14.291 --> 01:32:15.291
Noa!

734
01:32:17.208 --> 01:32:18.333
Noa!

735
01:32:40.875 --> 01:32:41.875
Noa!

736
01:32:41.958 --> 01:32:45.500
Noa! Noa! Noa!

737
01:32:46.416 --> 01:32:47.666
Noa!

738
01:33:04.416 --> 01:33:06.625
Noa, I'm coming!

739
01:33:06.708 --> 01:33:08.916
Noa!

740
01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.583
Noa!

741
01:33:41.250 --> 01:33:42.750
I'm here. Don't worry.

742
01:33:42.833 --> 01:33:46.333
I'm here. Noa. Noa.

743
01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:58.875
Everything's fine.

744
01:34:32.875 --> 01:34:33.875
Hm...

745
01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:48.708
We're almost there.

746
01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:54.375
We've almost made it. Don't give up now.

747
01:34:54.458 --> 01:34:55.958
Just gotta keep going

748
01:34:56.541 --> 01:34:57.625
for a while longer.

749
01:34:58.500 --> 01:34:59.583
Gotta hold on.

750
01:34:59.666 --> 01:35:02.208
We've gotta live to tell our story, Noa.

751
01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.041
Yeah, I know. They'll think we're crazy.

752
01:35:07.916 --> 01:35:09.583
But we know it's true, don't we?

753
01:35:12.500 --> 01:35:14.000
We put up a good fight, honey.

754
01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:19.500
We did everything we could, didn't we?

755
01:35:24.416 --> 01:35:26.000
My love, you saved me.

756
01:35:28.166 --> 01:35:29.416
You saved my life.

757
01:35:34.166 --> 01:35:35.166
Forgive me.

758
01:35:35.875 --> 01:35:37.208
I was so scared.

759
01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.875
But you gave me strength.

760
01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:46.250
And I did everything I could...

761
01:35:49.583 --> 01:35:50.875
didn't I?

762
01:35:50.958 --> 01:35:52.375
I did everything I could.

763
01:35:56.041 --> 01:35:57.458
I couldn't have done more.

764
01:36:02.666 --> 01:36:04.000
I did everything I could.

765
01:36:50.958 --> 01:36:53.000
- There's no fish, Dad!
- Wanna try this?

766
01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:55.166
Do you wanna say something?
No, no. I'm only joking.

767
01:36:55.250 --> 01:36:56.833
No, we only use the radio...

768
01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:02.041
I told you.
I think you have to move.

769
01:37:16.666 --> 01:37:18.750
Do you see those seagulls?

770
01:37:18.833 --> 01:37:20.208
Can we go a little bit closer?

771
01:37:39.416 --> 01:37:40.666
What's that?

772
01:38:04.166 --> 01:38:05.625
Jesus Christ.

773
01:38:07.250 --> 01:38:08.250
Hey.

774
01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:11.041
Where's his family?

775
01:39:53.291 --> 01:39:54.458
Come on!

776
01:40:00.833 --> 01:40:02.625
You can do it! Harder!

777
01:40:06.916 --> 01:40:08.916
That's it.
That's it. Turn her over.

778
01:40:09.500 --> 01:40:11.208
It's okay.

779
01:40:12.208 --> 01:40:14.708
It's okay. It's okay.

780
01:40:14.791 --> 01:40:15.791
It's okay.

781
01:40:16.458 --> 01:40:18.250
It's okay.

782
01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.833
Get her over.

783
01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.875
- Come on. Sit her up against there.
- Gently. There you go.

784
01:40:29.875 --> 01:40:32.291
- Okay. Just get her over here.
- Hey.

785
01:40:34.375 --> 01:40:37.166
You're okay. You're okay.

786
01:40:40.375 --> 01:40:42.166
My daughter? My daughter.

787
01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.125
- She's here, she's here.
- My daughter.

788
01:40:44.208 --> 01:40:46.208
Mayday, mayday. We have an emergency here.

789
01:40:46.291 --> 01:40:48.208
We pulled a woman
and a child out of the water.

790
01:40:48.291 --> 01:40:49.375
The woman's okay.

791
01:40:49.458 --> 01:40:51.791
She has...
We've given her CPR and she's alive.

792
01:40:51.875 --> 01:40:53.666
She's okay. She's not hurt.

793
01:40:58.166 --> 01:40:59.208
Hey. She's okay.

794
01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.916
Yeah, yeah.
We're on our way back now.

795
01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:06.375
We should be back in port
in about 20 minutes.

796
01:41:09.791 --> 01:41:11.631
Your jacket's soaking wet.
Need to take it off.

797
01:41:11.666 --> 01:41:13.291
No, no. Please don't. I want it on.

798
01:41:13.375 --> 01:41:14.975
- Please. Please.
- It's okay. It's okay.

799
01:41:19.375 --> 01:41:20.791
Are you hurt?

800
01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.458
Do you have other children?

801
01:41:26.083 --> 01:41:27.500
Were there others with you?

802
01:41:29.833 --> 01:41:31.541
You're okay, you're safe. Okay?
